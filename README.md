## WIP Thoughts

- dict comprehension init ptypes with index values, ptype or index as key?
- methods to pull ptype keys and values
- remove dict.get(key) for dict[key]
- balance -> avg naming?
- avg values / totals of tiers
- what does it mean to sum the +- 0,1,2 vs divide by 17
- always pass score with att/def tuple
- use enumerate
